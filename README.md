OTP_CODE_TEST CASE
A one-time password (OTP) is a unique code that is sent to a user for a single login session or transaction.
 OTPs are a strong authentication method that can be used to protect digital identities and network access.
**How they work**
OTPs are usually a string of numbers or letters that are generated and sent to the user via email, text message, authenticator app, or other mobile messaging channel.
 The user then enters the OTP into the system to verify their identity.
**How they are used**
OTPs can be used as a single-factor authentication method to replace a username and password, or they can be combined with other credentials for two-factor authentication (2FA).
